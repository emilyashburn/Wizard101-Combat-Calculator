A calculator to determine the wizard's prospective damage calculated by:

1) Base damage (dependent upon wizard's level / school)

2) Wizard's attire (Hats, robes, boots, wands, athames, rings, amulets, pets, and decks)

3) Charms / Traps / Shields

4) Opponent's resistance (Opponents can be players, bosses, or mobs)

This program also has a few boss presets. These presets are constructed upon popular/difficult bosses' resistances to all schools. The popular and rare "One in a Million" badge (deal over 1,000,000 damage to another player/monster) will be easier to attain with this calculator.
